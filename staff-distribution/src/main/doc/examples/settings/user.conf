# Java Email Server (JES) User Configuration
#
# All users are defined in this file.  To add a user, follow 
# the following pattern:
# user.<username@domain>=<plain text password>
# 
# The plain text password will be converted to a hash when the file
# is first loaded by the server.
#
# Additional configuration such as forward addresses can be specified as:
# userprop.<username@domain>.forwardAddresses=<Comma list of forward addresses>
#
# When a message is received for a local user, the user's address will be replaced
# with the addresses in the forwardAddresses property.  If you also wish to have
# a copy delivered to the local user, you may add the user's local address to
# the forwardAddresses property
